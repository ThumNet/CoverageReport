# CoverageReport
Coverage report is meant to be used inside a build environment (like TFS online), it will be able to:
 - produce a single HTML coverage report, including:
	- total coverage
	- coverage per folder
	- source code highlighting (covered and not covered)
 - [future] post the coverage to a data storage for analysis over time
